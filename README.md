The account settings page is insecure because it allows changing the user password without having to verify the user's identity. 

We added the requirement that users shall input their current password to ensure that only the legitimate user can change the password. We also added a security constraint in the web.xml to protect the account settings page from unauthorized access.

The rendered attribute ensures that the "Remove product" button is only shown for products that belong to the current user. If the product's username doesn't match the current user, the button will not be rendered.

The ViewState keeps track of the forms that are included in the web page when it is generated. When the web application receives a POST request, it checks the ViewState to see if the form in the request was actually part of the original page. If the form is not in the ViewState, the application will not process the request.

The @ConversationScoped annotation allows the backing bean to maintain the product state during the editing process.

The baking bean encapsulates the product, ensuring that the productID is not exposed and therefore cannot be tampered with. Only the methods within the bean can modify the product.
